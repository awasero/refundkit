# Introduction to RefundKit

RefundKit is refund infrastructure built for the AI era. It provides a unified API and SDK to process, track, and manage refunds across payment processors -- and an MCP server that lets AI agents handle refunds autonomously.

## The Problem

Refund processing is deceptively complex. Each payment processor has its own API, status codes, timing constraints, and edge cases. When you add AI agents to the mix -- customer support bots, automated dispute handlers, internal tools -- the complexity multiplies. Your agents need a consistent, safe interface to issue refunds without direct access to your Stripe dashboard.

## What RefundKit Does

RefundKit sits between your application (or AI agent) and your payment processors. It provides:

- **Unified refund API** -- One interface to process refunds across Stripe, with PayPal, Square, and Adyen coming soon.
- **MCP server** -- A Model Context Protocol server that gives AI agents like Claude, GPT, and LangChain-based agents the ability to process refunds as tool calls.
- **Policy enforcement** -- Check refund eligibility against your configured policies before processing.
- **Full audit trail** -- Every refund is tracked with status, timestamps, initiator (API, dashboard, or MCP), and metadata.
- **Type-safe SDK** -- A TypeScript SDK with Zod validation, discriminated error unions, and full type exports.

## Who Is RefundKit For?

- **Teams building AI customer support agents** that need to issue refunds during conversations.
- **SaaS companies** that want a programmatic refund layer with policy checks and audit logging.
- **Developers integrating multiple payment processors** who want one consistent refund interface.
- **Anyone using the Model Context Protocol** to give AI agents tool-use capabilities over financial operations.

## How It Works

```
Your App / AI Agent
        |
   RefundKit SDK or MCP Server
        |
   RefundKit API (api.refundkit.dev)
        |
   Payment Processor (Stripe, etc.)
```

1. You (or your AI agent) call `refunds.create()` or use the `refundkit_process_refund` MCP tool.
2. RefundKit validates the request, checks your policies, and routes the refund to the correct payment processor.
3. The processor executes the refund and RefundKit tracks status updates.
4. You receive a structured response with the refund status, ID, and metadata.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Refund** | A record representing a refund operation against a specific transaction. |
| **Transaction ID** | The original charge or payment ID from your payment processor (e.g., a Stripe charge ID like `ch_xxx`). |
| **Policy** | Rules that determine whether a transaction is eligible for a refund, including amount limits and time deadlines. |
| **Processor** | A payment processor integration (e.g., Stripe) that executes the actual refund. |
| **MCP Tool** | A tool exposed via the Model Context Protocol that AI agents can call to perform refund operations. |
