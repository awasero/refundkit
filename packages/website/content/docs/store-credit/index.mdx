# Store Credit

Store credit offers an alternative to cash refunds. RefundKit tracks credit issuance, redemption, and expiration. Credits can be issued as refund conversions, goodwill gestures, exchange differences, or promotional incentives.

## Issue Store Credit

```typescript
const { data: credit, error } = await rk.storeCredit.issue({
  customerId: 'cus_abc123',
  amount: 2500,              // $25.00 in cents
  creditType: 'refund_conversion',
  currency: 'usd',
  refundId: 'ref_xyz789',   // Optional: link to a refund
  expiresInDays: 365,       // Optional: credit expires in 1 year
});

console.log(credit.id);              // 'sc_...'
console.log(credit.remainingAmount); // 2500
console.log(credit.status);          // 'active'
```

## Get Store Credit

```typescript
const { data: credit, error } = await rk.storeCredit.get('sc_abc123');
```

## List Customer Credits

```typescript
const { data: credits, error } = await rk.storeCredit.listByCustomer('cus_abc123');

for (const credit of credits) {
  console.log(credit.id, credit.remainingAmount, credit.status);
}
```
