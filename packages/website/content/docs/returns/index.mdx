# Returns

RefundKit manages the full return lifecycle. When a customer needs to return a product, the SDK generates an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number, tracks the shipment, and can automatically trigger a refund upon receipt.

## Return Lifecycle

Returns move through a defined state machine:

`requested` → `approved` → `label_generated` → `shipped` → `in_transit` → `delivered` → `inspecting` → `completed`

At any point, a return can transition to `rejected`. Terminal states are `completed` and `rejected`.

## Create a Return

Create a return request linked to an existing refund. An RMA number is automatically generated.

```typescript
const { data: ret, error } = await rk.returns.create({
  refundId: 'ref_abc123',
  items: [
    { sku: 'SHOE-BLK-10', quantity: 1, reason: 'sizing_issue' },
    { sku: 'SOCK-WHT-M', quantity: 2, reason: 'defective' },
  ],
  method: 'mail', // 'mail' | 'in_store' | 'pickup'
  customerNotes: 'Shoes were too small, socks had holes.',
});

console.log(ret.rmaNumber); // RMA-20260223-K8M2N4
console.log(ret.status);    // 'requested'
```

## Get a Return

Retrieve a return by its ID.

```typescript
const { data: ret, error } = await rk.returns.get('ret_xyz789');

console.log(ret.rmaNumber);
console.log(ret.status);
console.log(ret.items);
```

## List Returns

List returns with optional status filtering and pagination.

```typescript
const { data: returns, error } = await rk.returns.list({
  status: 'shipped',
  limit: 25,
  offset: 0,
});
```

## Track Shipment

Track the shipment status of a return.

```typescript
const { data: shipment, error } = await rk.returns.trackShipment('ret_xyz789');

console.log(shipment.carrier);
console.log(shipment.trackingNumber);
console.log(shipment.status);
```

## Cancel a Return

Cancel a return that hasn't been shipped yet.

```typescript
const { data: cancelled, error } = await rk.returns.cancel('ret_xyz789');
```

## Return Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `requested` | Return request submitted by customer |
| `approved` | Return approved, awaiting label or shipment |
| `label_generated` | Shipping label created |
| `shipped` | Customer shipped the package |
| `in_transit` | Package in transit to warehouse |
| `delivered` | Package delivered to warehouse |
| `inspecting` | Items being inspected |
| `completed` | Return processed, refund issued |
| `rejected` | Return denied or items failed inspection |

## Item Reasons

| Reason | Description |

| `wrong_item` | Received incorrect product |
| `not_as_described` | Product doesn't match description |
| `no_longer_needed` | Customer no longer wants the item |
| `sizing_issue` | Wrong size or fit |

## MCP Tool

AI agents can create and track returns using the `refundkit_create_return` and `refundkit_track_return` tools.

## Next Steps
