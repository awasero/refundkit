# MCP Server Overview

The RefundKit MCP server gives AI agents the ability to process refunds as tool calls through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Instead of building custom integrations for every AI framework, you run one MCP server and any compatible agent can issue refunds, check statuses, and enforce policies.

## What Is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. It defines a structured way for AI agents to discover available tools, understand their parameters, and call them during conversations.

Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI" -- a universal plug that lets any compatible AI model use any compatible tool without custom wiring.

## Why AI Agents Need Refund Tools

AI customer support agents are increasingly handling the full lifecycle of customer interactions: answering questions, looking up orders, and resolving issues. But when a customer needs a refund, most agents hit a wall -- they either escalate to a human or require custom code to call payment APIs.

RefundKit's MCP server solves this by exposing five tools that handle the complete refund workflow:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `refundkit_process_refund` | Initiate a refund for a transaction |
| `refundkit_check_refund_status` | Check the current status of a refund |
| `refundkit_list_refunds` | List refunds with filters and pagination |
| `refundkit_get_policy` | Check whether a transaction is eligible for refund |
| `refundkit_cancel_refund` | Cancel a pending refund |

When an AI agent connects to the RefundKit MCP server, it automatically discovers these tools and can use them during conversations with customers.

## How It Works

```
Customer: "I want a refund for order #12345"
        |
   AI Agent (Claude, GPT, etc.)
        |
   MCP Protocol (stdio or HTTP)
        |
   RefundKit MCP Server
        |
   RefundKit API
        |
   Stripe (or other processor)
        |
   AI Agent: "I've processed your $25.00 refund.
              Refund ID: ref_abc123. It should appear
              in 5-10 business days."
```

1. The AI agent receives a customer's refund request.
2. The agent calls `refundkit_get_policy` to verify eligibility.
3. If eligible, it calls `refundkit_process_refund` to initiate the refund.
4. The MCP server routes the request through the RefundKit API to the payment processor.
5. The agent receives a structured response and communicates the result to the customer.

## Transport Modes

The MCP server supports two transport modes:

- **stdio** -- Runs as a child process. The AI framework launches the server and communicates over stdin/stdout. Best for local development and desktop AI applications like Claude Desktop.
- **HTTP (SSE)** -- Runs as a standalone HTTP server. AI agents connect over the network. Best for production deployments and multi-agent setups.

## Supported Frameworks

RefundKit's MCP server works with any MCP-compatible framework:

- [Claude Desktop](/docs/mcp-server/claude) -- Anthropic's desktop application
- [OpenAI Agents SDK](/docs/mcp-server/openai) -- OpenAI's agent framework
- [LangChain](/docs/mcp-server/langchain) -- Popular Python/JS agent framework
- [CrewAI](/docs/mcp-server/crewai) -- Multi-agent orchestration framework
