# Cancel Refund

```
POST /v1/refunds/:id/cancel
```

Cancels a refund that is currently in `pending` or `processing` status. Refunds in terminal states (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) cannot be cancelled.

## Authentication

Requires a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer rk_live_your_api_key_here
```

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | The RefundKit refund ID to cancel (e.g., `ref_abc123def456`) |

## Request Body

No request body is required. Send an empty JSON object or no body at all.

```json
{}
```

## Response

### Success (200)

The refund is returned with its status updated to `cancelled`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "ref_abc123def456",
    "organizationId": "org_xyz789",
    "externalRefundId": "re_1N4HcTKz9cXRvFYs",
    "transactionId": "ch_1N4HbSKz9cXRvFYr",
    "amount": 2500,
    "currency": "usd",
    "reason": "product_defective",
    "status": "cancelled",
    "processor": "stripe",
    "metadata": null,
    "initiatedBy": "api",
    "createdAt": "2026-02-22T10:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-02-22T10:35:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Not Found (404)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Refund not found",
    "code": "not_found"
  }
}
```

### Not Cancellable (409)

Returned when the refund is in a terminal state:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Refund cannot be cancelled — status is 'completed'",
    "code": "refund_not_cancellable"
  }
}
```

## Cancellable States

| Current Status | Can Cancel? |
|----------------|-------------|
| `pending` | Yes |
| `processing` | Yes (cancellation sent to processor) |
| `completed` | No |
| `failed` | No |
| `cancelled` | No (already cancelled) |

When cancelling a refund in `processing` status, RefundKit also sends a cancellation request to the payment processor. If the processor has already completed the refund, the cancellation may fail and the refund status will remain `processing` or change to `completed`.

## SDK Example

```typescript
import RefundKit, { ErrorCode } from '@refundkit/sdk';

const rk = new RefundKit({ apiKey: process.env.REFUNDKIT_API_KEY! });

const { data, error } = await rk.refunds.cancel('ref_abc123def456');

if (error) {
  switch (error.code) {
    case ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND:
      console.log('Refund does not exist');
      break;
    case ErrorCode.REFUND_NOT_CANCELLABLE:
      console.log('Refund is already in a terminal state');
      break;
    default:
      console.error('Cancel failed:', error.message);
  }
} else {
  console.log(`Refund ${data.id} cancelled at ${data.updatedAt}`);
}
```

## cURL Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.refundkit.dev/v1/refunds/ref_abc123def456/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rk_live_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## Use Cases

**Customer changed their mind**: A customer initially requested a refund but then resolved the issue. Cancel the pending refund before it processes.

**Duplicate refund request**: An AI agent or API integration accidentally created a duplicate refund. Cancel the second one before it processes.

**Fraud detection**: Your fraud system flags a refund as suspicious after creation. Cancel it while it is still pending.
